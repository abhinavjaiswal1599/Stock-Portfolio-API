Data Model Design:
Portfolio Schema:

Schema representing a portfolio with an array of trades.
Trades are referenced by their ObjectId.

Stock Schema:

Schema representing stock information with a unique symbol.

Trade Schema:

Schema representing individual trades with properties like stock (referenced by ObjectId), type, quantity, price, and date.
Document about Design Decisions:

Use of Schemas:

Utilizes Mongoose Schemas to define the structure of portfolio, stock, and trade objects.
Ensures data consistency and integrity through schema validation.
Reference Relationships:

Utilizes ObjectId references to establish relationships between trades and other models (e.g., stocks).
Facilitates efficient querying and population of related documents.
API Design:
Routes:
Provides RESTful API endpoints for portfolio management and trade operations.
Implements CRUD functionality for trades, along with endpoints for retrieving portfolio holdings and cumulative returns.
Thorough Documentation:
Response Format:
Ensures consistent response format across all API endpoints.
Responses include success status and relevant data or error message.
Error Handling:
Provides informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for better client understanding.
Asynchronous Operations:
Utilizes async/await for asynchronous database operations, ensuring non-blocking execution.
Middleware Usage:
Implements middleware for request body parsing and error handling.
Development:
Modular Structure:
Organizes code into separate files for models, routes, controllers, and services.
Promotes code maintainability and scalability.
Database Connectivity:
Establishes connection to MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Business Logic Separation:
Separates business logic from controller by implementing a service layer for trade operations.
Error Handling:
Implements error handling middleware to handle exceptions and provide meaningful responses.
